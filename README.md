## A Simple News Reader for Android

Presents a list of news article titles, and allows the user to view detailed information for each one.

This was developed for Project 5 (**Make Your App Material**) as part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

### Prerequisities

This app isn't available via Google Play, but you can build it and sideload it onto any Android device or Android emulator.

### Installing

After cloning the repository, build and install using [this guideline](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html)

## Using

Click a news article from the list to show the article.
Swipe down to refresh the article list.
When viewing an article, you can swipe left or right to go to next or previous articles.

As implemented, there are only 17 news articles, with identical text in each one. Even though the user can refresh the list, the list never changes.

## Development

The original working prototype was provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The basic functionality of the user interface was re-implemented using Android Studio, with an emphasis on Material Design.
